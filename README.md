# EMF-Standalone
EMF, compatible with java 9 modules, no Eclipse dependencies.

Current EMF version on master: 2.18.0.

To easily update this fork, I chose to keep a minimal list of commit in master; Then, I re-apply these commits on the new versions of EMF. I finally "store" the result in a dedicated branch for this version.
